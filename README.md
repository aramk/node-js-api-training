# Node.js API Training

Welcome! In this short training course I'll take you through the steps needed to build a Web API in Node.js. This course is intended for complete beginners to Node.js who ideally have some API programming experience in other languages and frameworks.

The training component of this course has been delegated to this excellent [Udemy course on Node.js](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2).

The remaining content involves building a practical application with the skills you learn in this course.
